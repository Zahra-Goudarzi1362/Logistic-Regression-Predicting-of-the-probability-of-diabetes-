Logistic Regression- Predict of the probability of diabetes based on some factors. 
Firstly Importing our libraries, then I imported the dataset. 
Selecting features as X and Y. 
Split X and Y into training and testing sets. 
Then I check accuracy of model which is good and drwed a plot. 
But there was some problem in plot to sove it I used proba method to get better plot.
Finally I get classification_report and predict the probability of diabetes based on new feature.
